    When he saw her he saw crimson. Lips painted with what she described as the blood of her enemies but what he knew was a healthy slathering of Chanel Number 5 Allure Velvet. She was bright red stilettos holding up a weightless girl who couldn’t help but lose her balance when too many tears fell on one half of her perfect face. She was cuts and bruises and minutes staring at a face in a shattered mirror. She wasn’t who her reflection defined herself as and only he knew that. She was the red Ferrari every kid said they wanted when they were young, speeding down a road with no end. She was both the glamour and the secret scandals of old Hollywood hidden behind fake smiles painted red. She was a mannequin for her ‘perfect’ family, a pawn in their one sided game of chess. She was red roses sent from a secret admirer and silk pyjamas bathed in red wine. She was maraschino cherries plucked from beneath the ice of a Shirley Temple and tying their stems into a knot with her tongue. She was late nights staring up at her ceiling, contemplating life, wishing he would call her so he didn’t have to. She cried on his shoulder but wouldn’t tell him why. She spoke in red but felt in blue. She was bitterly broken, hurt more than anyone else and in return he forgave her for breaking his heart. His heart bled for her and she bled into his open wound. <br>

    When she saw him she saw peach. He tasted sweeter than ice cream on a day so hot your thighs were just as sticky as your hands as you like sugary drops from your fingers. He was the crisp pop of opening the .99 cents can of Peach Arizona Tea, feeling your mouth dry before the sweet taste reaches your lips. He was fun in the scene he could conjure a smile from tear stained cheeks and simple situations. He was quiet with anyone but her, but not so loud that he didn’t absorb every word she said and soak up every tear that fell from her eyes with the open pores of his heart. He was poetry in a human vessel, using words that were unexpected from a boy who skateboarded more than he read. He was glasses slipping down the bridge of your nose and sleeping outside in the humid heat of summer. He was the heart skipping feeling of slipping a Gummi Peach Ring onto the finger of your crush in the middle of recess, down on one knee, begging for affection a young mind couldn’t really understand. He radiated an energy that wasn’t exactly happiness, but understated content and musical empathy. He was brown eyes that looked golden in the light of the sun and hair that was one shade too dark for his personality. He was long hugs and gentle kisses and hands pushing on your back as you fly off a swing and land just awkwardly enough to get tan bark stuck in your shin. He was her personal emotional support person. She took a bite of his peach and the skin got stuck in her teeth.<br>

    When he saw her he saw violet. She was lost, wandering, but curious. Eyes that swirled within lilac galaxies and a mind that tumbled down a rabbit hole. A soul that had aged like fine wine but still held the childishness of prancing through a winery with overripe grapes squelching between your bare toes. She was an adventure in human form. She was lost, but without a care in the world. It was as if she was forever traveling to the most beautiful place in the world with only a bit of fog in the mornings obstructing her view. She was wonderful, iridescent in a way. Always shifting but shining brighter than the sparkle in his eyes as he watched her from the background, mesmerized by her spirit. Stuck in the complicated web she spun in satin ribbon as she sashayed through life. He was falling down her rabbit hole with her. He was as curious of the obvious mystery she embodied as she was of the pit falls and mountain peaks of life. She was violet. He was now blind to any other color. <br>
    </br>


    When she saw him she saw evergreen. He was sharp and cunning but soft and out of touch. A heart of gold was shackled off within his chest to protect him from the words of those who judged him. He had a crystal mind that delved into every intellectual corner it could reach but eyes that were bored, unable to find something worthy of his interest. Until those eyes met hers, then promptly shifted away. He had boldness behind a shy exterior. Unknown but intriguing. Flowing through life waiting for something to whisk him away. He was a symphony of croaking frogs on a summer night and the vibrancy of green that only shows itself when it’s gray and rainy, when everything else is muted he captivates all lost attention. He was that fuzzy feeling early in the morning when you’re uncertain if your eyes are awake and your mind is asleep or vice versa. He was that spark of excitement you get when you swipe something off of a shelf or when you climb onto your moss-covered roof to watch the stars at night. As she twirled through life she used him as her spot. He was there for her, seemingly frozen, never moving. She was his next corner to search and she loved that. His golden heart gushed open just for her and as she peered through the cracks she caught a glimpse of his eyes crinkling with a sonorous laugh and his fingers plucking complicated chords mindlessly, mumbling jumbled sweet love confessions as lyrics. She couldn’t get enough of the perfection that was him. He was evergreen and she would forever only be seeing green. <br>

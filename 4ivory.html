    <p class="bronze"> Ivory Fear and Bronze Ginger Beer <br>
    </br>
    When he saw her he saw ivory. She was white, not because of her complexion but because of the eggshell fragility of her soul. She was not pure in the way that white declares itself on a flag but in the way that she was the purest form of spilled milk waiting to be cried over. She was invisible ink upon a blank sheet of paper, hiding in plain sight. She was snow shoved down one’s back and a swan’s confusion when her beloved lake has frozen over. She was cracked porcelain and soft linen sheets. She was the reflection on the whites of one’s eyes and headphones tangled up in one’s pockets. She was cold hands upon warm skin and the first cherry blossom in the spring. She was lace on the tops of your socks and the little bow that decorates the center of your bra. Her mind was a white line leading her forward and no fears could tarnish the untrodden path she walked. She was brittle bones and wishing stones that look plain until they’re brought into the sunlight to sparkle. Her teeth dawned the blinding color of her personality and once they clenched onto him he didn’t feel the need to tell her to let go.

    When she saw him she saw bronze. He was leaves crushed under slow-moving feet and socks sliding over hardwood floors. He was a poorly built treehouse with spiderwebs in the corners and exerting a little too much effort to take a bite of a stale biscotti. He was pages in a book, browned from age and moist along the edges, embedded with the scent of mildew, hiding, forgotten in a cardboard box in a basement that floods during the rainy season. He was the preference of cold ginger beer as opposed to warm apple cider. He was dust kicked up by dragging feet and names inscribed in dirt with sticks. He was the memories flooding in from one glance at your favorite teddy bear or the scent of your grandmother’s famous snickerdoodles. He was the mild anarchy felt in the stomach of a small child who makes the odd decision to always bite the head of a gingerman first, whether to spare them the misery or for the simple invigoration of destroying the helpless cookie, never a thing to cross their mind. He was butterscotch found at the bottom of one’s jacket pocket, its wrapper medned to its side, but popping it into your mouth anyways because candy was candy and a little paper never hurt anybody. He was the caramel drizzle over her vanilla ice cream, and she refused to eat any other flavor. </p>

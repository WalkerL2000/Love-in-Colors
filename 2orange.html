    <p class="evergreen"> Burnt Skies and Neon Lights <br>
    </br>
    When she saw him she saw orange. Not traffic cone orange or pumpkin orange, but the kind of orange that lights the sky on fire and burns it down to the coal color that it inhabits at night. The kind that spreads embers into the sky, transcending into twinkling stars. He was the burnt end to all of her cigarettes and the glow of the lava lamp of your twelve-year-old selves’ bedroom. He was passion as a person. The suffocating yet invigorating feeling in your chest as cold air attacks your lungs late at night, your feet slamming into the pavement of a suburban street, flickering street lamps shining upon your back. His smile was a rarity but sent fire ants crawling up her heartstrings. He was Orange Fanta that had gone flat but still stung when he made her laugh so hard it shot through her nostrils. It stained her white shirt. He had left a stain on her heart. <br>
    </br>


    When he saw her he saw neon blue, so bright it stung his eyes as she became the light of his life. She was azure and it wasn’t just because that was the name of the dye that painted her hair. She was as vibrant as one could be. She swirled within the psychedelics of the 70s. She pranced along with the obnoxiously loud pigment of leg warmers from the 80s. She danced to the iconic 90s blues of Nirvana’s Nevermind album and Weezer's Blue album. She became all of these rolled into one transcendent being that embodied the strobing lights of the modern day club. She was car lights reflected on wet pavement and Christmas lights draped throughout an otherwise drab room. She caught one’s eye in the way a neon sign does when one letter has lost its light. She was studded heels and bare shoulders that he couldn't help but warm with his own hoodie. She was the feeling of closing your eyes and seeing lights interrupt the illusional abyss created by your eyelids. Her light had permanently imprinted his abyss. </p>
